IMPORTANT: Only include topics that are ACTUALLY required for a ${role} position. For example:
- HR roles: Focus on communication, behavioural, HR processes, labour laws - NO DSA
- Product Manager: Focus on product thinking, metrics, stakeholder management - minimal DSA
- Data Analyst: Focus on SQL, Excel, statistics, visualization - basic DSA only
- Frontend Developer: Focus on HTML/CSS/JS, frameworks, browser APIs - light DSA
- ML Engineer: Focus on ML algorithms, statistics, Python - moderate DSA
- Software Engineer: Full DSA, System Design, OOP
- DevOps: Focus on CI/CD, cloud, infrastructure - minimal DSA

Format your response EXACTLY as JSON like this:

    {
      "name": "Pattern/Topic Name",
      "description": "Brief description",
      "questions": [
        {

          "difficulty": "Easy|Medium|Hard",
          "leetcode": "https://leetcode.com/problems/problem-slug/",
          "youtube": "https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=topic+title+explanation"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "tips": ["tip1", "tip2", "tip3"],
  "resources": ["resource1", "resource2"]
}

Generate 6-8 patterns with 6-8 questions/topics each relevant to ${role}.
For non-technical roles like HR, skip leetcode links and focus on interview questions and resources.
Return ONLY the JSON, no extra text.`;
